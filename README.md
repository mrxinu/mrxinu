# Steven Klassen

I'll definitely write more here when I get a little time to myself, but for now
this is me in a nutshell:

- Primarily writing code in Go, SQL, and PowerShell.
- Learning Esperanto so my daughter and I can talk s***t in front of mean girls
  in school.
- Learning every day that I'm no longer in my 20s.
